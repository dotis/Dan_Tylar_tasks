### List of items for Dan and Tylar

- [ ] Add 2nd depth for temperature buoy on FGBNMS dash
- [ ] NERRS data on SEUS dash (next mtg. 2/26 - should have some NERRS data up on dash by then)
- [ ] Weird display issue with polar (0-360 degrees) data in grafana/influxDB (SEUS dash)
- [ ] Look at OBIS data in Mid Atl. Bight region - Tylar (can we add to dash?)
- [ ] Add sand layers and temp. logger data to SEUS dash (Dan), don't add logger locations to map - use station names
- [X] Get manglilloo up - need to install gpt
- [ ] Climate dash - add products and projections for other sanctuaries (workshop in September)
- [ ] Heat maps and time series for PR and the VI (ongoing - perhaps we can use the Thurs. 11am meeting time to look at this w/Digna)
- [X] FK Water quality tool (meeting on 5/13 - need to revise "How to use this page" text) - Send to Tylar in a document
- [X] Get FWC dash up and running

For now, priorities are #2 (NERRS data)
