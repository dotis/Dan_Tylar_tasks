### List of items for Dan and Tylar

- [ ] Add 2nd depth for temperature buoy on FGBNMS dash
- [ ] NERRS data on SEUS dash (next mtg. 2/26 - should have some NERRS data up on dash by then)
- [ ] Weird display issue with polar (0-360 degrees) data in grafana (SEUS dash)
- [ ] Look at OBIS data in Mid Atl. Bight region (can we add to dash?)
- [ ] Add sand layers and temp. logger data to SEUS dash (Dan), don't add logger locations to map - use station names
- [X] Get manglilloo up and install MATLAB (need to check errors - Doug)
- [ ] Climate dash - add products and projections for other sanctuaries (workshop in September)
- [ ] Heat maps and time series for PR and the VI (ongoing - perhaps we can use the Thurs. 11am meeting time to look at this w/Digna)
- [ ] FK Water quality tool (FCRCT meeting on 3/19 - We need to have an updated tool by then)
- [X] Get FWC dash up and running

For now, priorities are #2 (NERRS data) and #6 (FKWQ tool)

Manglilloo is up. MATLAB install remains
