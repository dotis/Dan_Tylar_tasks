### Plan for IMaRS IT and dashboard continuity 

In the case of extended absences by IMaRS personnel, there should be a continuity plan

### Tasks/items to go in plan
1. Admin passwords
2. IMaRS servers - how to access user accounts, check logs/status
3. Other?

### Dashboards
1. Google cloud server and data bucket access (password?)
2. Docker - ability to access and restart
3. InfluxDB - ability to clear and restart(?)
4. Airflow - how to check DAG logs
5. Satellite Image files/scripts and extracted .csv files - documentation needed (put on Github)
